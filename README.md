# Happy Times Mod ...for Mindustry
This mod makes Erekir turrets and units work on the Serpulo planet, among other things.

<br>

**WARNING:**

This is effectively a cheat mod. This mod makes the Serpulo campaign very easy, because it gives the player access to over-powered units and turrets. Don't use this mod, if you don't want the original game-play of the game spoiled for you!

<br>

**Notes:**

All researchable components are unlocked right from the start. This includes all turrets, walls, buildings and units.

<br>

All worker drones build faster. (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Evoke, Incite, Emanate)

<br>

The cost of turrets, walls and buildings have been reduced to zero.

<br>

All units in the game can be created for free, by using any of the newly provided unit factories.

<br>

The movement speeds of Tier 5 units are increased somewhat.

<br>

Item sources, liquid sources, and power sources are available for free.

<br>

Some popular combat units can now also build buildings on the map, similar to worker drones.
